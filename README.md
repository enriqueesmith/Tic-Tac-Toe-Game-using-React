# Tic Tac Toe Game using React

A simple game of Tic Tac Toe built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Webpack and ReactJS. Once the users open the application, a blank game of Tic Tac Toe will appear. The users must choose whether they want to be X or O.
The first player to go is X, then O. To play the game simply click on the square you wish to occupy and either an X or an O will appear depending on who's turn it is.
Once somebody wins, an HTML element is introduced that pronounces the winner. To start a new game, simply click "Reset".
